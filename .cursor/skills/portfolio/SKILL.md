# Overview

This project is a dual-identity portfolio and that must never change. The site must always represent two professional profiles coexisting with equal importance: Frontend / Software Engineer and Technical Artist / VFX. Navigation, structure, and visual hierarchy must preserve this duality at all times. One profile must never overshadow or visually invalidate the other. They may be separated by sections, routes, or presentation style, but they must always share a coherent, unified identity.

The site supports dark mode and light mode as first-class experiences, not as cosmetic variants.
Dark mode must always use #020617 as its base background color, with a deep, bluish, navy-toned aesthetic. Green-tinted dark backgrounds are not allowed.
Light mode should feel soft, warm, and calm, inspired by matcha, cream, and pastel tones.
The two modes must never visually bleed into each other. Components such as footers, overlays, or backgrounds must not be duplicated or mixed across modes.

Design quality is a core requirement. The UI must remain clean, modern, and carefully composed, with strong attention to spacing, alignment, and readability, especially on large screens. Excessive margins, inconsistent alignment, or unfinished layout decisions are not acceptable. The site should always feel polished and intentional, closer to a finished product than a prototype.

Motion and animation are part of the design language, not decoration. Animations should be creative but controlled, smooth, reversible, and clearly connected to user interaction and scroll. When scroll-driven layouts are used, the experience should feel like a sequence of full panels or screens, not traditional document scrolling. Text or sections must never visually overlap in an uncontrolled way, and there should be no confusing intermediate states.

Content-heavy sections such as Projects, Experience, and Skills should favor bento-style layouts, both visually and in how they interact with scroll. Cards should behave as clear, self-contained units, with deliberate reveal and transition patterns. Long flat lists or default scrolling layouts should be avoided when a more structured, animated presentation is possible.

Any future change must be evaluated with a single question:
Does this preserve the dual-portfolio identity, visual clarity, and high-quality animated experience of the site?
If the answer is not clearly yes, the change should not be introduced.
